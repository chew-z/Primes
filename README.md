# Primes

## Sieving primes and counting primes

This is a code base that I have accumulated over years playing with prime numbers on my free time. Initially I did runthis code in Pythonista on my iPhone. This is adopted to run on laptop with python3.

Prime sieves come mostly from [this thread on Stackexchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068372/fastest-way-to-list-all-primes-below-n) - I have adapted some to python3. A little is forked form[ this github project](https://github.com/badele/prime-number). Other sources are in the code. Not all. 

I have also added few tricks on my own.
